- **`SENDER_EMAIL`**: The email address used for sending reports.
- **`SENDER_PASSWORD`**: The app-specific password for the sender email.

#### **How to Obtain the RapidAPI Key**
1. Go to the [RapidAPI SimilarWeb Insights API](https://rapidapi.com/opendatapoint-opendatapoint-default/api/similarweb-insights/playground/apiendpoint_349e6b92-24b8-4f38-8563-f9a856872fb6).
2. Sign up for a free account if you donâ€™t already have one.
3. Once signed in, subscribe to the API and generate your unique API key.
4. Use this key as the value for `RAPIDAPI_KEY` in your `.env` file.

#### **How to Generate the App-Specific Password**

1. Go to your Google Account settings and navigate to the **Security** tab.
2. Under the **Signing in to Google** section, locate **App Passwords**.
3. Follow the instructions to generate a 16-character app-specific password for the application.
4. Use this generated password as the value for `SENDER_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file.

Ensure the `.env` file is not tracked by Git by adding it to `.gitignore`.
